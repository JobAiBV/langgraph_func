`langgraph_func` makes any LangGraph graph available as an Azure Function without changing how you build the graph itself. Every graph can act as a standalone API endpoint or be called as a subgraph from another graph.

Documentation lives in the `docs` folder. The most important topics are:
- [Graph structure](docs/source/01-graph-structure.md)
- [Function app deployment](docs/source/02-deployment.md)
- [YAML configuration](docs/source/03-yaml-function-app.md)
- [Helper functions](docs/source/04-helper-functions.md)
