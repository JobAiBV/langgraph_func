blueprints:
  v1:
    path: v1
    description: |
      This blueprint, “test_blueprint”, is responsible for handling core
      graph operations in the testing environment. It groups together
      related graphs and defines their shared authentication method.
    graphs:
      graphA:
        path: graphA
        source: graphs.graph
        auth: FUNCTION
        description: |
          GraphA ingests raw data from the primary “graph” source,
          applies transformation logic, and outputs structured
          results for downstream processes.
      graphB:
        path: graphB
        source: graphs.graph_b
        auth: FUNCTION
        description: |
          GraphB connects to the secondary “graph_b” data source,
          performs enrichment steps, and validates data integrity
          before exporting.
  v2:
    path: v2
    description: |
      The “test_blueprint_2” blueprint extends the testing suite
      with additional graphs for experimental features and
      prototyping new data flows.
    graphs:
      GraphA:
        path: GraphA
        source: graphs.graph
        auth: FUNCTION
        description: |
          new_graph is a variant of GraphA configured for
          experimental transformations and performance benchmarking.
      GraphB:
        path: GraphB
        source: graphs.graph_b
        auth: FUNCTION
        description: |
          newer_graph builds on GraphB’s logic with extra
          validation rules and custom metrics for early
          feature testing.
